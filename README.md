# Malt
Is a modular plug-and-play alternative to host an ATMega 328P-PU chip.

Malt system is divided in two parts:
 - The main board
 - The modules

The main board have many outputs based on USB (4 wires) to host the modules. Each output can host just one module (for now).

When a module is connected to an output, the main board indentifies the module and automatically "integrate" to itself.

This project is in initial state of progress.

You are welcome to join.
